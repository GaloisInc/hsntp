HSNTP - Haskell Simple Network Time Protocol

Simple Network Time Protocol is a simple subset of NTP. This package
includes Haskell libraries to use SNTP Protocol and small client and
server implementations. The package contains everything needed for a compilation.

Compiling and installation

   Download and unpack.
   Build and install through Cabal as for other Haskell packages:

        runhaskell Setup configure --user --prefix=$HOME
        runhaskell Setup build
        runhaskell Setup install --user

  (You may want to remove the --user flag when installing as root.)


Dependencies

The library depends on GHC, but porting should not be too hard as the
code is quite short.


sntpdate server

Sntpdate fetches the date from an (s)ntp-server and tries
to set the local clock.


sntpd

Sntpd serves the local clock to interested (s)ntp clients.
The program forks into the background. Needs a wrapper
for non-root operation as ntp runs in a privileged port.
